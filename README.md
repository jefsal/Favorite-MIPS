# Favorite-MIPS

## Project Goal
This repo collects four MIPS32 mini-projects from CSC-256 that changed the way I think and write when I program. Each one focuses on low-level control flow, data layout, and disciplined reasoning.

## Projects
 - Ancient-Robot-Game: turn-based grid survival game with autonomous robot pursuit
 - Big-Int: prints a 64-bit integer in a 32-bit register environment using long division
 - Factorial: iterative factorial with input validation and formatted output
 - Recursion-Factorial: recursive factorial with explicit stack frame management

### How to run
 1. Download MARS (MIPS Assembly and Runtime Simulator) IDE from the official source
    - More here dpetersanderson dot github dot io
 2. Open the .asm file in MARS
 3. Assemble and Run using F3 then F11
 4. Follow the console prompts
