# Factorial

## Project Goal
This program computes factorial iteratively and prints a clean, formatted result. It is a focused exercise in loops, arithmetic, and basic I/O in MIPS32.

## How it works
 - Prompts for input and validates a positive integer
 - Uses a loop-based multiply accumulator to compute n!
 - Prints the full sentence output using syscalls

### How to run
 1. Download MARS (MIPS Assembly and Runtime Simulator) IDE from the official source
    - More here dpetersanderson dot github dot io
 2. Open Factorial.asm in MARS
 3. Assemble and Run using F3 then F11
